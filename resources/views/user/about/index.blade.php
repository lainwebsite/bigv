We relentlessly share our <i>knowledge</i> and <i>expertise</i> in helping <b>Home Based Businesses (HBB)</b> in enhancing their skills and techniques.

By building a strong <i>community based business</i>, we aim to be the <b>No.1 online marketplace for HBB in Singapore</b>.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Besides promoting HBB online, we also encourage them to take up physical stall/space at our <b>Albert Street Pasar Malam @ Tekka Place</b>. It is a unique project that BigV is proud of. Continuing the tradition of Albert Street shophouses residents, our HBB gets to showcase their talents and skills to public onsite. Our <b>BigV Community Caf√©</b> at Tekka Place aims to create community based workshops run by our HBB for adults and children, to enjoy learning skills passed down by Ah Gong and Ah Ma; <i>from cooking, baking to handicrafts, you name it, we will curate it specially for you!</i>
